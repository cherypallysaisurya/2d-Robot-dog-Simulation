- ✅ Professional .gitignore and build configuration

### 2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- ✅ **Windows**: Full threading support with PowerShell/Command Prompt compatibility
- ✅ **macOS**: Threading-safe implementation addressing Tkinter GUI limitations
- ✅ **Linux**: Complete dependency management for Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora distributions

### 3. **Educational Focus**
- ✅ Student-friendly API designed for beginners
- ✅ Progressive complexity examples (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)
- ✅ Visual learning outcomes with immediate feedback
- ✅ Classroom-ready activities and challenges

### 4. **Publication Ready**
- ✅ Successfully published to **TestPyPI** (Version 1.0.1)
- ✅ Uploaded to **GitHub** repository with professional documentation
- ✅ Installation instructions for all major platforms
