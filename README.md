## 🎯 What Is This?

Imagine a tiny **blue robot** — shaped like a triangle — moving around a colorful grid, leaving a bright **red trail** wherever it goes. This package transforms abstract programming concepts into **visual, hands-on experiences** for learners, especially beginners!

The **Robot Behavior Simulator** empowers students to learn coding fundamentals by writing simple commands to:

- Navigate mazes  
- Avoid obstacles  
- Create intricate patterns  

All with **instant visual feedback** that makes learning engaging and intuitive.
