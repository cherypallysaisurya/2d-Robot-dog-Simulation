## 🎯 What Is This?

Imagine a tiny blue robot — shaped like a triangle — moving around a colorful grid, leaving a bright **red trail** wherever it goes. This package transforms abstract programming concepts into **visual, hands-on experiences** for learners, especially beginners!

The **Robot Behavior Simulator** helps students learn coding fundamentals by writing simple commands to navigate mazes, avoid obstacles, and create patterns — all with **instant visual feedback**.

from robot_behavior import create_robot_program

# Create a 5x5 grid world with the robot starting at (0,0)
program = create_robot_program(5, 5, 0, 0)

# Add some walls (obstacles)
program.add_wall(2, 2)
program.add_wall(3, 2)

# Command the robot to move around
program.robot.move('right')
program.robot.move('right')
program.robot.move('up')
program.robot.move('up')

# Show the animation window with the robot's journey
program.start()
