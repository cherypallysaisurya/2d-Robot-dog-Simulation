Robot Behavior Simulator - Educational Programming Framework

An engaging Python package that teaches programming concepts through visual robot simulation.
Perfect for beginners learning their first programming concepts!

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
- ðŸ¤– Visual Robot: Triangle arrow that moves smoothly around a grid pointing east
- ðŸ”´ Red Trail Visualization: See exactly where your robot has been
- ðŸ§± Obstacles & Walls: Navigate around barriers and solve maze challenges  
- âš¡ Immediate Feedback: Instant visual results help students understand their code
- ðŸ“š Educational Focus: Designed specifically for teaching programming fundamentals

Quick Start:
    from robot_behavior import create_robot_program
    
    # Create a 5x5 grid with robot starting at (0, 0)
    program = create_robot_program(5, 5, 0, 0)
    
    # Move the robot and watch the red trail appear!
    program.robot.move('right')
    program.robot.move('up')
    program.robot.move('backward')
    
    # Start the visual display
    program.start_with_auto_close(5)

Educational Concepts Taught:
- Sequential Programming: Execute commands in order
- Conditional Logic: Handle success/failure of movements
- Loops and Patterns: Create repeating behaviors
- Problem Solving: Navigate mazes and avoid obstacles
- Debugging: Use move logs and position checking

Perfect for educators teaching Python programming to beginners!
